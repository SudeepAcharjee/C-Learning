## What's Inside?

### Basic Programs

Learn fundamental programming concepts such as operators, loops, conditional statements, arrays, pointers, and structures through practical examples and exercises.

### Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Explore various data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and priority queues.
Implement classic algorithms such as sorting (insertion sort, bubble sort), searching (linear search, binary search), and other algorithms relevant to data manipulation and optimization.

### Basic Level Projects

Dive into hands-on projects covering diverse domains including system utilities (file compression, database management), gaming (snake game, number guessing game), user authentication (OTP-based login system), academic (student grade system, library management), and finance (banking management).
